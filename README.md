## Introduction
JnRMaker is a Tile and sprite / level editor and test environment.

## Information
JnRMaker uses a couple of libraries, which should be mentioned at this point.

One of them is [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), which I realy love and I am happy that I can use it. Please check out the github of Omar and support his work.

Another great library is SFML ([github](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)). Check also out the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) webpage.
